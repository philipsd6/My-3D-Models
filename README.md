# My 3D Models
This repository contains a collection of 3D models I've developed using Python (build123d, etc.)

## Repository Structure

Here is a detailed outline of the repository structure:

- `ball_in_a_box.py`: Contains the python code for creating the classic ball in a box model.

- `coffee_filter_holder.py`: Contains the python code for creating a holder for Hario V60 coffee filters.

- `terraforming_mars`: A directory dedicated to terraforming Mars related models.
   - `files/aimfeld`: The source files used to extract measurements for my design.
   - `player_mat.py`: Contains the python code for creating a player mat for Terraforming Mars.
   - `player_mat_parser.py`: Script used for parsing the player mat data from the source models.

## How to Use

Ensure you have suitable 3D modeling software installed:
- [OCP Cad Viewer for VS Code](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer)
- [build123d](https://github.com/gumyr/build123d/)

Run the python scripts in your Python interpreter to generate the 3D models.
